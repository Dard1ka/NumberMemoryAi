# NumberMemoryAi
Number Memory AI is an Artificial Intelligence-based game that trains number memory and English pronunciation skills using Speech-to-Text technology.

Players will memorize a series of numbers (0–100), then recite them in order. The AI system will process the voice in real-time and provide accurate assessments based on a model that has been fine-tuned specifically for number recognition.

Objectives
- Train memory retention through gamification
- Improve pronunciation of numbers in English
- Explore the implementation of AI Speech Recognition in web applications
